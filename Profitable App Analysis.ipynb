A counter that notes the frequency of non ASCII characters is included in the function and if the frequency of these non_english characters occurs more than three times then the string is classed as non english. There is the chance that genuine english-speaking audience targeted apps contain more than three non ASCII characters, but this margin of error is tolerable for this stage of our analysis. The process of making the function is as follows:\n",

This shows that although the navigation category is the most downloaded and initially seems attractive to get high volume of traffic, it also has a concentrated market that will have high barriers of entry due to the qualities such as brand names, with google and wave being legacy names, making it difficult for our company to take their customers.

    "Looking at the most popular apps for android will need a similar approach to calculate the average number of installs per genre, unlike the iOS dataset, we have an install column in the dataset so it will be a more explicit result. There were two columns used in the common apps analysis for the android data set, but the 'genres' column was far to fragmented- making it hard to ascertain the messeage, therefore the 'category' column will be used as the representative to the android genres. To do this analysis I:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initialised a variable with the output of the frequency table function applied. The inputs to the function were the android data set with the index number of the 'category' column.\n",
    "- A loop is run over the genre keys of the frequency function dictionary output\n",
    "- Initialise a variable for the total number of installs and also the number of apps in a genre to be used in the average calculation\n",
    "- Run a loop over every app in the final android data set\n",
    "- Initialise the column for the category data\n",
    "- Inside the nested loop a conditional if statement which will execute its clause if the category name of the app in the final android data set is equal to that from our frequency dictionay key\n",
    "- The clause isolates the installs column and replaces the + and , with an empty string as the installs were a range e.g. 100,000+ installs. This is taken to be 100,000 installs for that app for example, to make analysis simpler.\n",
    "- These install string values are then converted to floats and added to the total variable initisalised earlier\n",
    "- Simultaneously, a value of 1 is added to the length of the category, counting how many apps in that category\n",
    "- The average calculation is done and the nested loop is finished, the nex iteration of the outer loop (next category) is run and the whole process starts again.\n",
    "- The output is not ordered, so its copied into an excel sheet, where the text to columns function and custome sort functions are used that allow us to order them from largets to smallest for an easier read of the output."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of app that will meet the company objective of generating the most user engagement, and also coincided with the strategy to have it on both app stores is that off social networking and communication type apps- with the added opportunity for harnessing synergies and incorporating features from other popular genres such as Music and Reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "A social networking app focused around music is recommended as a potentially popular app to develop is recommened. This is evident from the consistency of social networking in both app stores and also music, in addition it draws on traits common in both app stores, with the practical type apps of android that can be evident in feautures of this app that could be to do with news, reference, information and eductaion with the entertainment side of things drawm from the iOS store.\n",
    "\n",
    "The market is very fragmented so this presents opportunity to assess our competitors capabilities and learn how they are differentiating themselves from each other, this will provide for more robust information in a further analysis of the app development side, assessing what features are impactful to users.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overlapping of categories presents the opportunity for harnessing synergies related to each individual category and creat a 'one-stop shop' type strategy when designing the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Step\n",
    "\n",
    "- For a more robust analysis,the data cleaning methods could be refined as there were some non-english audience speaking apps that appeared after the cleaning process. Although the impact on the analysis is assumed to be negligable, a deeper cleaning will enusre a more robust assessmnt\n",
